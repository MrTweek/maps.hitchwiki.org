Good day to you all. It was about time to take our great Maps service and make it even better! And shiny! And orange.
<br  /><br />
It's not anymore just about you and your hitchhiking places, but everybody can comment, rate and contribute. Just like in our Wiki. Still it's not a Facebook... it's not blue you know. We tried our best to make it as usable and good (and orange) as possible, but hey why don't you <a href="mailto:help@liftershalte.info" title="help@liftershalte.info">drop us</a> a line of feedback, did we succeed?
<br /><br />
We now also have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hitchwiki/133644853341506" title="Go to Facebook">Hitchwiki Facebook Page</a>, to where you can join in and get recent updates about Hitchwiki.
<br /><br />
Ok. Ta. Be well.
<br /><br />
PS. You can show your love to us and recommend Hitchwiki Maps to your <br />
hitchhiker pals on Facebook by pressing this cute little button with a familiar icon on it:

<script type="text/javascript">
    $(function() {
    	FB.XFBML.parse(document.getElementById('pages'));
    });
</script>
